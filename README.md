## Description
This is a trivia game where you have a time limit to answer each of the ten questions.  Each question only allows you 30 seconds to think about before it times out, shows you the answer, and moves on to the next question.  You are then given a final result page at the end of the game and an option to restart.

The page responds entirely with clicks.  First you have to click the start button, and then for each of the questions, click on one of the four options that is the correct answer to the question.  Once you've made your choice, the page will alert you if you are correct or incorrect.  If you wait too long, the page will move on automatically.  After the 10th question, the page will show you how well you performed on the quiz.

This page was a practice in making a dynamic page with jQuery as well as using timers to only allow you 30 seconds on each question.  It also uses timers on the screens after making a selection so that the page won't stay there beyond a few seconds.  I developed each of the questions as an object with properties that I could then append to different parts of the page to make the quiz.  I then put all of these objects in an array so that I could use them more easily with the JavaScript.
